Viewbert is a new way to write reusable Views

Welcome to Viewbert.
With Viewbert, you can finally write views views you can actually reuse. Just place your view anywhere and have fun with it.
ViewComponents can, if you want, be instantiated once and reused when you turn your display and your activity gets destroyed.
ViewComponents can even work completely senza Activities.
We use Viewbert ViewComponents in a 100k+ App to achieve our floating chat: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shadoweinhorn.messenger

Try ViewComponents today :)
Look at the example, it's that/dead simple.
